# Test assignment

This repository contains detaied analysis of Online Retail data provided by the UCI.

`DataPreparation.ipynb` is devoted to the preliminary data processing. It contains mostly technical steps, but this may be important for understanding of the future notebooks.
`EDA.ipynb` contains exploratory data analysis that provides relevant bustiness insights:
 * Seasonality of the business
 * Geography of customers
 * The overall company's revenue
 
`Product_categorisation.ipynb` contains analysis of the products sold by the company. There is an attempt of categorisation of products by names, but in the end I deceded to choose simplier categorisation by the price of the products

`Customer_categorisation.ipynb` splits the customers into groups according to their purchase patterns and product purchases, and characterises the obtained customer personas. I also describe churning of users here.
